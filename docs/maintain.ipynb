    "Unless stated otherwise, Poetry uses [carets](https://python-poetry.org/docs/dependency-specification/#caret-requirements) to specify requirements. This basically claims that your package is compatible with new versions of your dependencies as long as these versions do not change too much.\n",
    "\n",
    "The caret system avoids the burden to constantly update your `pyproject.toml`. However, there is always a moment when your package become incompatible with the latest version of one dependency. Incompatibility can be semantic (e.g. the latest version is outside the caret range) or real (the latest version does not behave like you expect it to do).\n",
    "\n",
    "Being incompatible with latests versions will not stop anyone from installing your package in a dedicated environment (docker, `venv`, ...) where the version of each dependency is controlled by `poetry.lock`. However, it will be harder and harder for users to use it in their main Python environment. For example, imagine that the `numpy` requirement of your package is `^1.22.4` (e.g. `>=1.22.4` and `<1.23`) and that the latest Pandas requires `numpy>=1.23.2`. This means that everytime you install your package in its latest version you will have to downgrade Pandas, and conversely.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is why you should regularly bump the versions of our dependencies, and releases are a good opportunity to do that. Forcing users to upgrade to more recent (stable) versions of dependencies is always preferred to forcing downgrades."
